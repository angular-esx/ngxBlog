<h2>What is Component?</h2>

<p>In Angular 2, components are the main way we build and specify elements and logic on the page.</p>

<br/>

<p>Components are the most basic building block of an UI in an Angular application. An Angular application is a tree of Angular components. Angular components are a subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template and only one component
  can be instantiated per an element in a template. A component controls a portion of the screen—a view—through its associated template.</p>

<br/>

<p>A component must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be usable by another component or application. To specify that a component is a member of an NgModule, you should list it in the declarations field of that NgModule.</p>

<br/>

<p>In addition to the metadata configuration specified via the Component, components can control their runtime behavior by implementing various Life-Cycle hooks.</p>

  <a xblog-source-code [href]="components.simpleComponent.sourceCode.link">Full Code</a>
  <xblog-code [innerHtml]="components.simpleComponent.codeBlocks"></xblog-code>
</xblog-code-panel>

<br/><br/>

<p>We use <strong>Component</strong> to add some metadata to AppComponent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A selector that specifies a simple CSS selector for an HTML element that represents the component.</li>
  <li>A template that tells Angular how to render the component's view.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, we have component <strong>Class</strong> that controls the appearance and behavior of a view through its template. Here, we only have the root component, AppComponent. Since we don't need any application logic in the simple example, it's empty.
</p>
<br/>

<p>We export the AppComponent class so that we can import it into the application.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We are using angular 2 by Javascript, so we need at least constructor function. If we don't have the logic for component, we need to create empty constructor function as above component.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Component's Metadata Properties</h2>

<p>A component needs at least 2 metadata properties: selector and template. So, it can have a lot of metadata properties to handle logic and behavior.</p>

<br/>

<p>Here is a component using <strong>inputs</strong> to list of class property names to data-bind as component inputs and <strong>outputs</strong> to list of class property names that expose output events that others can subscribe to.</p>

<br/><br/>

<p>In addition, a component has many others metadata properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>animations</strong> - list of animations of this component.</li>
  <li><strong>changeDetection</strong> - change detection strategy used by this component.</li>
  <li><strong>encapsulation</strong> - style encapsulation strategy used by this component.</li>
  <li><strong>entryComponents</strong> - list of components that are dynamically inserted into the view of this component.</li>
  <li><strong>exportAs</strong> - name under which the component instance is exported in a template.</li>
  <li><strong>host</strong> - map of class property to host element bindings for events, properties and attributes.</li>
  <li><strong>inputs</strong> - list of class property names to data-bind as component inputs.</li>
  <li><strong>interpolation</strong> - custom interpolation markers used in this component's template.</li>
  <li><strong>moduleId</strong> - ES/CommonJS module id of the file in which this component is defined.</li>
  <li><strong>outputs</strong> - list of class property names that expose output events that others can subscribe to.</li>
  <li><strong>providers</strong> - list of providers available to this component and its children.</li>
  <li><strong>queries</strong> - configure queries that can be injected into the component.</li>
  <li><strong>selector</strong> - css selector that identifies this component in a template.</li>
  <li><strong>styleUrls</strong> - list of urls to stylesheets to be applied to this component's view.</li>
  <li><strong>styles</strong> - inline-defined styles to be applied to this component's view.</li>
  <li><strong>template</strong> - inline-defined template for the view.</li>
  <li><strong>templateUrl</strong> - url to an external file containing a template for the view.</li>
  <li><strong>viewProviders</strong> - list of providers available to this component and its view children.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is Directive?</h2>

<p>Directive allows you to mark a class as an Angular directive and provide additional metadata that determines how the directive should be processed, instantiated and used at runtime.</p>

<br/>

<p>Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM..</p>

<br/>

<p>A directive must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be usable by another directive, component, or application. To specify that a directive is a member of an NgModule, you should list it in the declarations field of that NgModule.</p>

<br/>

<p>In addition to the metadata configuration specified via the Directive, directives can control their runtime behavior by implementing various Life-Cycle hooks.</p>

<br/>

<p>This is a HightLight directive to hight light a text with dynamic color.</p>

<h2>Directive's Metadata Properties</h2>

<p>The directive does not have template and style, but it has a lot of the metadata properties to handle behavior</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>exportAs</strong> - name under which the component instance is exported in a template.</li>
  <li><strong>host</strong> - map of class property to host element bindings for events, properties and attributes.</li>
  <li><strong>inputs</strong> - list of class property names to data-bind as component inputs.</li>
  <li><strong>outputs</strong> - list of class property names that expose output events that others can subscribe to.</li>
  <li><strong>providers</strong> - list of providers available to this component and its children.</li>
  <li><strong>queries</strong> - configure queries that can be injected into the component.</li>
  <li><strong>selector</strong> - css selector that identifies this component in a template.</li>
</ul>
